            <p>Whenever you finish a long rest during which you wear this ring, you find a selection of toadstools have grown on the limb that sports this ring. Roll a <strong>d4</strong> twice and consult the table below to determine which two mushrooms have grown. If you choose to attune to this item, the ring causes four mushrooms to grow instead of two.</p>
